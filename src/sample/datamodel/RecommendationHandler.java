public class RecommendationHandler {
//    Purpose of this class is to handle the logic for recommending movies based on the user preferences.

//    Idea: NonRegisteredUser has a number of votes given for movies. When he wants to receive recommendations the algorithm will
//    calculate a similarTaste value for each other user and rank the 5 most similar users in a List. Afterwards the other movies they liked
//    will be recommended provided the IMDB rating is above a certain level.
